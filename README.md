# Database Management Systems Project: ITU  Helper
## Introduction
This project aims to help ITU students in social interactions and to solve 
daily problems they encounter in university life or in campus.

The website performs on the base of membership. Users will have to sign up 
with their e-mail address so that an account can be created. However, they will 
have the option for changing their usernames.

This project aims to solve many of the problems of students such as:
1. The website contains a section for students who would like to acquire 
useful information about their selected courses. Volunteer upper class students 
would answer their questions, provide them with useful tips and, where appropriate, 
share their notes of former classes there.

2. The project also contains a section that book and lesson notes are shared. Used lesson 
books can be shared or sold in website by users. As another, users can find lesson notes 
for ITU lessons. This notes are put by other students.

3. There are students who are bad at some university subjects and therefore in need of 
private tutors. In addition, there are students who are good at these subjects and 
could tutor the weaker students. Therefore, the website has a section to arrange 
the contact and meeting of those students with each other. The parts in the section are 
the university subjects, the students who would like to find a tutor for the subject(s) 
they would like to be supported and the possible tutor candidates

4. Many ITU students live in student house and sometimes, it can be difficult to 
find a home or room. The website brings together people who are looking for 
a home or a room and people who want to share a house or a room.

5. The quality and the price of meals is very important for every student. Therefore, 
the website has an evaluation system for the quality and prices of the meals at 
every restaurant and cafeteria in the university. The users are able to sort the places 
according to their prices and users' evaluations through using it. In addition, 
the problem of lacking information about the structure and content of meals in 
the refectory would be solved by placing the photos of every single meal and 
the users' evaluation forms in the system.

6. There is a section in the website for the users who search for their 
lost properties and the users who would like to share the time and place information 
about the properties they found. The records will also contain the date. Therefore, 
students would only need to check the system to find out whether their lost properties 
had been found. The people only need to check the system for their lost properties. 
This will result a considerable advantage because most of the time people do not remember 
the exact time and places where they lost their properties.

7. A section for the sport activities in the campus, activities of the student clubs 
and activities of the ITU is integrated in the website. Students will be able to join 
them through registration on the system if respective activity has one.

8. There is also a section, which could help students to find playmates. The reason
for this is that university students mostly play games, including table games and 
video games, to relax and spend their leisure time. However, it is not easy to find 
congenial playmates, especially in the busy campus life. Therefore, students who are 
looking for playmates could post a message in this section that could be seen by others. 
As a consequence, they could contact each other so that determine the place and time for 
playing a table game like backgammon and uno, or they could decide to play a multiplayer 
video games. This would help students in building new friendships and socialization.
